      <p>
      As the frontend developer and project manager of our capstone project, I took on a dual role that demanded both technical skill and strong leadership. I was in charge of crafting an engaging, responsive user interface while also managing timelines, delegating tasks, and keeping the team focused on our shared vision. Leading the project wasn’t just about ticking boxes—it meant staying sharp, anticipating problems before they happened, and making sure no detail slipped through the cracks. Thankfully, I wasn’t new to leading a team. My past experiences helped me steer the group with clarity and confidence. One of the best parts? I had great chemistry with our programmer—we were always on the same page. That synergy meant faster decisions, smoother development, and zero unnecessary drama. The result? A project that not only met expectations but exceeded them.
<br></br><br></br>
I’m also incredibly thankful to my group members for their cooperation, dedication, and the teamwork they brought to the table. Their ability to collaborate and stay engaged made everything flow smoothly from start to finish. Without their contributions, the whole process wouldn’t have been as seamless. Together, we were able to push forward and complete everything well ahead of schedule, which meant we could submit the project on time and pass the subject early without the fear of getting an INC. It’s a relief knowing that our collective effort paid off, and I couldn’t have asked for a better team to work with.

      <p>
      Taking on the role of both frontend developer and project manager for our software engineering, I was constantly balancing technical work with leadership duties. Leading a team of five brought its own set of challenges—more people meant more ideas, and more ideas sometimes led to confusion and misalignment. Keeping the team’s vision focused and ensuring smooth collaboration wasn’t always easy, but it was necessary to make the project work.
      <br></br><br></br>
Despite these challenges, my team, AEONFLUX, delivered and triumphed. Even though we received an INC remark, we didn’t let it hold us back. We pulled together, pushing through the struggles, and managed to rise above the obstacles. We were able to submit the project successfully, showing not only our technical skills but also our resilience and ability to work through adversity. It was a test of both leadership and teamwork, and in the end, we succeeded because we never gave up.

    <label for='work3'>OBRA</label>
    <br></br>
      <p>
      I was the sole frontend developer for OBRA, an e-commerce web app built for buying and selling authentic, handcrafted goods. The platform is dedicated to empowering local artists by giving them a digital space to showcase and sell their work—everything from paintings, wood carvings, and clay pots to all kinds of artisan crafts. With no backup on the frontend, I took full ownership of the UI/UX development, translating our vision into a responsive, user-friendly interface that highlights each artist’s work. From layout design to functionality and responsiveness, every pixel and interaction was crafted with intention. It was a challenging solo mission, but seeing OBRA come to life as a creative marketplace made every late-night coding session worth it.

      <p>
      With the same team behind OBRA, I also took on the role of frontend developer for our second project, Rate My Carinderia—a web app built to spotlight local carinderias and connect them with food lovers. The platform lets users browse and rate eateries based on location, food, price, and service, helping people discover hidden gems that match their taste and budget. Our mission was to give local food vendors a digital space to shine and uplift Filipino cuisine. While the system wasn’t perfect, we gave it everything we had—pushing through limitations with resourcefulness, teamwork, and a shared drive to make something meaningful.

    <br></br>
      <p>
      EduEarn is a web app designed to help job-seeking students find part-time opportunities that align with their schedule, skills, interests, and knowledge. Whether it’s a weekend gig or a flexible remote role, EduEarn streamlines the search and connects students with jobs that actually fit their lives. I served as the frontend developer for this project, building a clean, intuitive interface that made the job-hunting experience feel less overwhelming and more empowering. From dynamic filtering to responsive layouts, I focused on making the platform as user-friendly and accessible as possible for students navigating both school and work.
